Problem Statement – MealDrop - A Food Delivery Service

We live in a fast-paced, constantly changing world that revolves around technology. Life goes by in a blink of an eye, and our memories fade more and more each day. 
MealDrop is a food delivery service with 100s of restaurant partners in over 10 metropolitan cities. We help restaurants accept orders through their partner portal online or through the partner mobile app and prepare them. The delivery partners are responsible for pickup and delivery through their logistics application, while the consumers use the app from Google's PlayStore or AppStore to browse restaurants and place orders

As part of the solution, MealDrop will build three apps:
    MealDrop - The app available on PlayStore / AppStore for consumers to browse restaurants, their menus and place orders
    
    MealDrop Restaurant Partner - The app that is installed on Restaurant Manager's mobile phone, which is used for receiving and accepting new orders
    
    MealDrop Delivery Agent - The app used by delivery agency to pickup delivery from the restaurant, and deliver to the given address



For the first milestone, MealDrop is looking to build the backend APIs for the three apps as three different microservices and needs your help to implement the application.

    Step 1: Create three projects, one each for microservice "MealDrop API", "MealDrop Restaurant Partner API", "MealDrop Delivery Agent API“

    Step 2: Configure a separate database deployment for each microservice. You may choose to use NoSQL database of your choice (preferably MongoDB)

    Step 3: Implement the APIs, implement JWT Authorization, and ensure that the APIs are working with OpenAPI Spec shared above
